# AEGIS_SURRENDER v0.1

This is a simple script that I made to simulate a surprise surrender, where
if you approach an enemy behind less than 1.5 meters, you have a chance to surrender it and render it. Initially this coefficient is 60% but later I will implement others parameters like if the enemy is so injured or if all of your group are dead and others, and these parameters can increase the coefficient to surrender the enemy.
If you distance more than 10 meters and the enemy is out of sight he will return to its initial state.
